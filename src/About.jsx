            I like to travel. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language and all the small unique things every place has to offer. And I like to play cricket on weekends <span role="img" aria-label="winking">ðŸ˜‰</span>.</p>
